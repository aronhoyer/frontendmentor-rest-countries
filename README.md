## So what stack we running?

It's a basic [Express](https://expressjs.com) server that serves up static files from `public/dist`.

The front-end is written with HTML, JavaScript and SCSS, and transpiled through [Parcel](https://parceljs.org).

## Run it locally

1. `git clone git@github.com:aronhoyer/frontendmentor-rest-countries.git`
2. `npm i` (or `yarn`)
3. `npm run dev` (will compile front-end code and run the server)
